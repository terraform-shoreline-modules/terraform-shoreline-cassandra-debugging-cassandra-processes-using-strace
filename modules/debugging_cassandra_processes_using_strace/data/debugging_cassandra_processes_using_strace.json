Strace is a debugging tool that can be used to monitor system calls made by a process, which can help diagnose problems such as application crashes, performance issues, and other errors that may occur during the Cassandra process. This process is commonly used by software engineers and developers to troubleshoot issues with Cassandra and is an important step in resolving incidents related to this database management system.",
